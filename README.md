# WebDevTutorial
Full Stack Web-Development Tutorial,

This web-site was built and designed while following an online WebDev course online.

* The course is by GoCode Sderot - in Hebrew
* The course filmed on the desktop of the instructor, with his voice , 
     including conversations during the class.
* The course was published in Youtube
* The Instructor is Elad Cohen
* AFAIK - the actual course started around January 2019 and has not ended yet (april 2019)

Some notes about the course and the web-site:
* The web-site was first created as acomment book
* Since the web-site was developed step by step with the ongoing course, 
     the design and sophistication of the web-site is advancing 
     with the knowledge granted in the course
* Every once in a while, I go through previously created pages and re-design, enhance them according to better methods I've learnt.
* The design / Structure of the web-site may change dramatically, according to the progress of the course
