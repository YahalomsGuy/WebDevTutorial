# WebDevTutorial
Full Stack Web-Development Tutorial,

This web-site was built and designed while following an online WebDev course online.

* The course is by GoCode Sderot - in Hebrew (and despite that face, the web-site was built in english, I really cannot say why....
* The course filmed on the desktop of the instructor, with his voice , 
     including conversations during the class.
* The course was published in Youtube at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIld0affiSkmp-KkEit3S_w
* The Instructor is Elad Cohen
* The course is teaching:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Object Oriented Programming
  * JavaScript
  * JSON
  * AJAX
  * Node.JS
  * Express.JS
  * .......
* AFAIK - the actual course started around January 2019 and has not ended yet (april 2019)

Some notes about the course and the web-site:

* The web-site was first created as acomment book.
* Since the web-site is developed for usage along with an IDE, the layout of the web-site is intentionally very narrow!!!!
* Since the web-site was developed step by step with the ongoing course,the design and sophistication of the web-site is advancing with the knowledge granted in the course 
* Every once in a while, I go through previously created pages and re-design, enhance them according to better methods I've learnt.
* The design / Structure of the web-site may change dramatically, according to the progress of the course


Where this thing is going? I really have no Idea......
